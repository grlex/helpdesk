Simple helpdesk web app powered by Symfony framework
========================
In the heart of the system are HelpDesk user requests for problems that need to be addressed.
Each request has its own life cycle: multiple stages from the beginning of work on the request before it is completed.
The user specifies the category of the request: to what category approximately it can relate - whether it's a problem with the equipment,
whether it is a software problem, whether the user has personal problems and he wants to talk about them.

The user can add the request comments and attach the image and also specify a priority: something needs to be done urgently while others can be delyed.

The person with the status of moderator is viewing new requests and assigns them to the executors.

Executors are already viewing their assigned requests and process them simultaneously updating their status.

Well, at the head of this system lies the figure of the administrator who manages the system users - adds, deletes, etc., assigns users roles.
